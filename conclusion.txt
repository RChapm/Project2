For professional and business services hires, we had fit an ARIMA(0,1,1)+Seasonal Dummies model. The seasonal coefficients reflect that the hiring peak occurs in April. Because of the dominance of a stochastic cycle, the seasonal dummies inaccurately characterize the seasonality. For Financial Activity hires, we had fit an ARIMA(1,1,1)+Seasonal dummies model to the series. The seasonal coefficients reflect that the hiring peak occurs in February and summer. Again we see that the seasonal dummies cannot capture the varying seasonality of the hiring. Our models for both series tends to break down during the recession, as indicated by the recursive residuals and CUMSUM plots.

The result of a VAR model which tries to forecast both series simultaneously shows that both series are strongly affected by seasonality first and foremost. The residual seasonal fluctuations can be seen to show up in the Impulse Response functions. This suggests for a us a direction to work towards: a better model should be able to separate the seasonality from the VAR process, so the VAR assumptions about the errors hold.  Furthermore, business hires showed more persistence in its own impulse response than finance hires. The reason is unclear to us and should be a future direction of investigation. We have not found strong causality between the two hiring series in our present procedure, which is expected for a preliminary analysis of the data. A far more promising direction would be to perform the same analysis over all pairs of such hiring series to tease out those which can be accurately described with our model.
